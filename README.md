# Calculator-in-Android-studio
First  personal/practice project on Android Studio in JAVA. 
The calculator has 4 buttons and 2  blank places to enter the numbers. The results are shown beneath the buttons on UI.  

The code currently has no errors in MainActivity.java or activity_main.xml. There some warnings in the both file. 
Whenever an operation is selected after entering values, the app closes.
